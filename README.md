### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Mas-Ponte and I am a Ph.D. student at the Genome Data Science Lab at IRB-Barcelona.
I work in cancer genomics and I try to study patterns of mutagenesis in patients to better understand
the biology of tumors. I have around 4 years of expirience with a broad set of applications in R, from
statistical modeling to visualization. I am also expirienced in software pipeline usage/maintainance (and sometimes
also development). I am intereseted in data visualisation and data journalism.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analysis of local hypermutation patterns in human tumors.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any bioinformatic open source software or pipeline.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for toy projects that help me learn Rust or C++.
