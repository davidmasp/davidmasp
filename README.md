### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Mas-Ponte and I am a Ph.D. student at the Genome Data Science Lab at IRB-Barcelona.
I work in cancer genomics and I try to study patterns of mutagenesis in patients to better understand
the biology of tumors. I have around 6 years of expirience with a broad set of applications in R, from
statistical modeling to visualization. I am also expirienced in software pipeline usage/maintainance (and sometimes
also development).
